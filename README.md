# CAPTCHA_Decoding
The aim of this project was to develop a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) capable of decoding CAPTCHA (Completely Automated Public Touring test to Tell Computers and Humans Apart) images with 4 or 5 characters. The CNN model had to be designed, implemented and trained. The performance of the developed model was then evaluated, taking into account different evaluation metrics.
